    <div class="abstract">
        We have developed a novel information theory based multi-scale clustering algorithm for identifying variable
        length mutational hotspots within cancer genes. We ran our algorithm on the combined mutation data from 23 tumor
        types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We found a diverse set of clusters with wide variability in size and
        mutation count. Additionally we integrated our mutation clusters with gene expression data from TCGA to
        associate clusters with global changes in gene expression and specific molecular pathways. Our findings allow us
        to identify mutation clusters which are associated changes in gene expression phenotype. Additionally we have
        used our pathway association analysis to identify multiple clusters within individual genes which have
        differential associations: specifically
        <a href="/seqpeek/?gene=PTEN&tumor=UCEC">PTEN</a>,
        <a href="/seqpeek/?gene=FUBP1&tumor=LGG">FUBP1</a>, and
        <a href="/seqpeek/?gene=CDH1&tumor=UCEC">BRCA</a>
        These cases may be indicative of differential
        functional consequences to genetic mutations within different regions of the same gene.

            1) 549 genes with a total of 33507 pan-cancer mutations are run through our multiscale clustering algorithm
            resulting in 1255 clusters. More text...
